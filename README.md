```

## Usage

### Squircle

Squircle is an UIView extension, and can be used in different ways:


```swift
let view = UIView()
view.squircle()
```

just apply conventional squircle radius to the view. If the view is a square, i'll obtain the same effect as iOS springboard icons, if it's a rectangle i'll obtain rounded corners based on a square built on smallest side.

Squircle is also an CALayer extension, permitting you to add a squircle mask directly on a layer.
Rules are the same as the UIView methods, invocation is:

```swift
let layer = CALayer()
layer.applySquircle()
```

### Squircle with border

If you want to apply squircle with a border use the dedicated methods:


```swift
let view = UIView()
view.squircleWithBorder(width: CGFloat, color: UIColor)
```

```swift
let layer = CALayer()
layer.applySquircleWithBorder(width: CGFloat, color: UIColor)
```
